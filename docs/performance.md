## Theory

- [The USE Method](https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html)
  > The Utilization Saturation and Errors (USE) Method is a methodology for analyzing the performance of any system. It
  > directs the construction of a checklist, which for server analysis can be used for quickly identifying resource
  > bottlenecks or errors. It begins by posing questions, and then seeks answers, instead of beginning with given
  > metrics (partial answers) and trying to work backwards.
