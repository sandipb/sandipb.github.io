- [Distributed Systems: Physical, Logical, and Vector Clocks](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/distributed-systems-physical-logical-and-vector-clocks-7ca989f5f780): Nice post by Joe Honour explaining logical and vector clocks

# CAP Theorem

- :fontawesome-solid-graduation-cap: [Towards Robust Distributed Systems](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262b-2004/PODC-keynote.pdf) :fontawesome-solid-file-pdf: : Eric Brewer's original paper on CAP theorem.

- [DBMS Musings: Problems with CAP, and Yahoo’s little known NoSQL system](http://dbmsmusings.blogspot.com/2010/04/problems-with-cap-and-yahoos-little.html): Daniel Abadi's post about how to use PASELC instead of CAP to understand the tradeoffs in design. A paper/article on this is available [here as well](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/papers/abadi-pacelc.pdf) :fontawesome-solid-file-pdf:.
- [Please stop calling databases CP or AP](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html): Martin Kleppmann's post critiquing the CAP theorem. This post has a good section on explaining linearizable consistency.
- [CAP Theorem: You don’t need CP, you don’t want AP, and you can’t have CA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUd_9FENShA) :fontawesome-brands-youtube: : A really good talk by Siddhartha Reddy introducing CAP and PASELC

# 3. Consistency models
